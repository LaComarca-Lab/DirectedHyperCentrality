# Spectral centrality of directed hypergraphs

This repository contains the scripts, data and (pre-processed) figures/tables from the "Beyond directed hypergraphs: heterogeneous hypergraphs and spectral centralities" paper by G. Contreras-Aso, R. Criado, M. Romance, published in [Journal of Complex Networks](https://doi.org/10.1093/comnet/cnae037)), and available as a preprint at [arXiv:2403.11825](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11825).

## Structure of the repository

The following files and directories are briefly summarized.
- `tensor_functions.py, useful_functions.py`: Tensor construction functions and centrality computations (power-like method based on the code from [1], as well as other utilities.
- `0-*.ipynb, 1-*.ipynb, ...`: Jupyter notebooks with the data pipeline (`Data/` -> `ParsedHyperedges/` -> `ProcesseHypergraphs/` -> `CentralityData/` -> `Figures/`), from the raw data downloaded/scraped from each data source (cited in the paper), to the construction and analysis of adjacency tensors and their centralities.
- `kstepHypergraphs.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the construction and analysis of k-step centralities of standard networks located at `DirectedNets/`.
